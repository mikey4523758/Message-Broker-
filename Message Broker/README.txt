Message Broker

This project is a Rust-based message broker system implementing a basic publish-subscribe model over TCP. 
It consists of two main components: a broker (server) and a client that can act as either a producer or consumer. 
The system handles multiple concurrent client connections using threads and shares state safely via Arc<Mutex<>>.
